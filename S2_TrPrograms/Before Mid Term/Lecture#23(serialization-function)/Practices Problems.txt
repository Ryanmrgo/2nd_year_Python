Practices Problems

Problem1-Provide a list comprehension expression for each of the following lists.
(a) [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
(b) [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25. 1.5]
(c) [('a', 0), ('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 0), ('b', 1), ('b', 2)]
Problem2
Write a Python program that creates the matrix
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Problem-3Are tuples mutable or immutable?
Problem-4. Are the elements in tuples ordered or unordered?
Problem-5Given the following dictionary:
d = {3:0, 5:1, 10:1, 8:2, 15:4}
Indicate what each of the following code fragments will print:
(a) print(d)
(b) for x in d:
print(x)
(c) for x in d.keys():
print(x)
(d) for x in d.values():
print(x)
Problem-6
Create the Sapnish to English dictionary to describe the English words to Spanish word. And print the  sapanish  word that is similar to  English  form this list
’hello’ is ’hola’
’yes’ is ’si’
’one’is ’uno’
’two’ is ’dos’
’three’ ’tres’
’red’ ’rojo’
’black’’negro’
green’ ’verde’
’blue’ ’azul’
Problem6
Write a python program which prints a given list to a reverse 
string or integers or floating point data elements and print 
the data elements into another list.
Example:
Original list:[13,68,19,40] 
Reverse list: [40, 19, 68, 13]
Problem7
If A and B are sets then Cartesian product is the sets of 
pairs(a,b) where a is in A and B is in B.
A×B=(a,b)| a subset of a , b subset of B)
A=1,3,5
B=2,4
(1,2) (1,4 ) (3,2) ,(3,4) ( 5,2) (5,3)
Write a python program to display the result of Cartesian 
product which has four data elements and 3 data elements in 
each list. Notes you need to write your program using 
comprehension.
Problem-8
Write a Python Program to get a list of numbers as input from 
a user and calculate the sum of it. You have to take input 
from the user and you need to display the sum of the result 
of any number of list.
Problem-9
Create a tuple that contains data elements 0 to 9 and create 
another second tuple by adding one element in first tuple as 
shown in the following. Write a program to print the final 
tuple that contain adding the data elements of two tuples as 
shown in the following.
Tuple1=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Tuple2=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
Tuple3=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3
Problem-10
5.1 Assuming that a shop sells only one type of mobile
accessory, take the name of the shop and the accessory
the shop and store these data elements into appropriate
data type. Your program should be able to retrieve the
data and print the data using python.
S1 – Battery, S3 – Strap, S5 – Pouch and so on
5.2 Assuming that a shop sells more than one type of
mobile accessory, take the name of the shop and
accessories the shop sells and store these data elements
into appropriate data type. Your program should be able
to retrieve the data and print the data.
S1 – Battery, Pouch, Strap, S3 – Strap, Speaker, Cover,
and so on
Problem11
Imagine that you have the movies list as shown in following
,display the movie’s title which are start with letter G. You have to
use comprehension for this python program.
Notes:str.startswith(search_string, start, end)
Titles of Movies are
Star Wars,Gandhi, Casblance, Shawshank Redemption, Toy
Story, Gone with the wind, Citizen Kane, It’s a wonderful Life,
Gattaca, Ghostbusters, To kill a monkingbird, Hunting,
Groundhong Day, Close Encounters of the Third Kind
Problem-12
 you have two sets 3,4,5,6,8 and 9,3,5,6,7 . Write a python 
program to perform different types of set operations in 
python.


Python problem set
There is a shop for selling different kind of fruits such as orange, apple, grape, guava,palm,pineapple.
This shop is needed to display the available kind of fruits at
the shop. Customer also want to know if the fruits they want 
to buy are available or not in this shop. If the new items of
fruits are arrived in the market, the shop keeper want to sell
these new items (banana,papaya)(item can be one or more) at this shop. 
Sometimes, there are no more fruits at the special season
and then shopkeeper want to discard the overripe fruits (not
good to sell for the customer) from the shop or want to
replace with other kind of fresh fruits available in market.
Write a python program to satisfy these condition and use
the appropriate data type  to store the fruits and use the methods and operations to satisfy these condition.
Write a program to maintain books information in MIIT’s 
library as per their serial number and other information as
shown in the following using appropriate data type in python
at least three books. You should retrieve and print the data. You can search the book according to the ID and Title and if found you should print the message that you found that book.
Serial number MIIT-LIB- 00001
Title= Core Python Programming
Author=Dr. R. Nageswara Rao
ISBN=978-93-86052-30-8
Class no =005 etc....
Serial number MIIT-LIB- 00002
Title= Python Cook Book
Author=ABC
ISBN=978-93-86352-30-9
Class no =005 etc....
In this case, Title , Author , ISBN and class no in the book can
be the same for some of the books.

(a)The function input() takes an integer as input. State 
whether this statement is True or False.
(b)Membership operators ‘in’ can be used with list only. State 
whether this statement is True or False.
(c)State the output of executing the following expressions in 
python:
(25//2+3.5)<=(7.5+20)
(60^5)==(90^70)
(d) []==[] is True while [] is [] False.
