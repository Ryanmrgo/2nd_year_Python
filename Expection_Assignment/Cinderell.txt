Once upon a time, there was a beautiful, kind-hearted girl called Cinderella, who
lived in a farfar away land. She lived with her stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and two
step-sisters, Anastasia and Drizella. As her stepmother was not very fond of her, she
had asked Cinderella to live in the attic. Two cute little mice named Gus and Jaq
and the chirping birds became her best friends in her new room. Her stepmother
and stepsisters made her do all their household chores. Cinderella woke up early in
the morning when it was still all dark to start the fire for their household. She
cooked all meals, worked in the kitchen, and kept the fire going to warm their
house. Poor Cinderella used to get ashes and cinders all over her clothes and body
from the fire. People say her real name was Ella, but her stepsisters and
stepmother called her Cinderella as she always had cinders on her clothes.
